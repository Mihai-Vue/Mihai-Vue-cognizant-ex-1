        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Derek Prince's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1915</strong>- Born in India of British parents.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1920</strong>- Derek and his mother made the long voyage
            back to England so that Derek could live with his grandparents and
            go to a proper English school.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1929</strong>- Entered Eton College and so joined the ranks
            of England's emerging elite. He would walk in the footsteps of
            nineteen prime ministers, two signers of the American Declaration of
            Independence, and some of the greatest thinkers, artists, and
            explorers the world has ever known: Aldous Huxley, George Orwell,
            Percy Shelley, Randolph Churchill, Ian Fleming, Henry Fielding, John
            Whitehead, Thomas Merton, and John Maynard Keynes. It was assumed at
            Eton that its students were destined for greatness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong>- Wrote for the school newspaper, joined the
            Essay Society, and became wild about Shakespeare, winning the
            school's Shakespeare Medal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1940</strong>- Joing the army that Britain was about to go
            to war against Germany.

            <strong>1941</strong>- Was selected to attend a non-commissioned
            officer's course in Scarborough, Yorkshire.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong>- While stationed at a training barracks in
            Scarborough, Yorkshire, he experienced a powerful encounter with
            Jesus which would change the course of his life. Recalling the
            experience he said:

            <blockquote>
              "I heard the voice of Jesus, speaking very very clearly through
              the scriptures, the Bible. And from the day I heard His voice, to
              this day, there are two things I’ve never doubted. I’ve never
              doubted that Jesus is alive, and I’ve never doubted that the Bible
              is the Word of God.
            </blockquote>
            So began the spiritual journey of one of the 20th century's most
            prominent Bible teachers.

          <li>
            <strong>1975</strong>- Lydia Prince passed away peacefully at the
            age of 85 surrounded by family. She is the author of Appointment in
            Jerusalem which was published shortly before her death the same

            American single mother of three adopted children. They met in
            Jerusalem while Derek was visiting Israel with friends.
          </li>
          <li>
